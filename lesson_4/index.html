                                William John Paul Gallagher was born in the Longsight area of Manchester on 21 September 1972, the son of Irish immigrant parents Peggie and Thomas Gallagher. The family later moved to the city's Burnage area. When he was 10, Peggie took him and his brothers and left Thomas, whom she divorced four years later.[5] Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, their issues remain unresolved; notably, while drinking at a pub after an Oasis show in Ireland during the height of their fame, Liam noticed his father from across the room and had to be calmed down by Noel. A leaked phone call later revealed that he subsequently called his father and threatened to break his legs if he ever saw him again.[6] The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens, and Liam often shoplifted bicycles from local shops.

                                Gallagher was educated at St. Bernard's RC Primary School and the Barlow Roman Catholic High School in Didsbury. Despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, he was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term and gained four GCSEs in 1990.[7][8] He preferred sports at a young age, having no interest in music. During his teens, he suffered a blow to the head with a hammer from a student at a rival school, which he credits with changing his attitude towards music.[9] After this incident, he became infatuated with the idea of joining a band.[8] He became confident in his ability to sing and began listening to bands like the Beatles, the Stone Roses, the La's, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, and T. Rex. In the process, he became obsessed with the Beatles' John Lennon, and would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon reincarnated despite being born eight years prior to Lennon's death.[10] He would also help Noel with his job as a roadie for Inspiral Carpets and worked as a tax collector for HM Revenue and Customs.

                                When school friend Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan invited Gallagher to join his band The Rain as a vocalist, he agreed. He was the band's co-songwriter, along with guitarist Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs. Noel has since openly mocked this writing partnership, describing them as being "just awful", and Liam also admitted that they were "shit".[8] The band only rehearsed once a week and did not get many gigs. It was at one of their rare shows in 1991 at the Boardwalk in Manchester that Noel, having recently returned from touring internationally as a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, saw them perform. In 1993, Oasis played a four-song set at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow, where Alan McGee of Creation Records discovered them and signed them for a six-album deal. The band's debut album Definitely Maybe was released on 28 August 1994, and went on to become the fastest-selling British debut album of all time. Liam was praised for his vocal contributions to the album, and his presence made Oasis a popular live act. Critics cited influences from the Beatles and Sex Pistols. Liam's attitude garnered attention from the British tabloid press, which often ran stories concerning his alleged drug use and behaviour. In 1997, Definitely Maybe was named the 14th greatest album of all time in a "Music of the Millennium" poll conducted by HMV.[12] In Channel 4's "100 Greatest Albums" countdown in 2005, the album was placed at No. 6.[13] In 2006, NME placed the album at No. 3 in a list of the greatest British albums ever.[14] In the 2006 book of British Hit Singles and Albums, the album was voted the best album of all time, with the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band finishing second.[15] Q placed it at No. 5 on their greatest albums of all-time list in 2006, and NME hailed it as the greatest album of all time that same year.

                                The band's second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? was even more successful, becoming the third-best selling album in British history.[16] Around this time, Oasis became embroiled in a well documented media-fuelled feud with fellow Britpop band Blur. The differing styles of the bands now leading the Britpop movement—Oasis a working-class northern band, and Blur a middle-class southern band—made the media perceive them as natural rivals. In August 1995, Blur and Oasis released new singles on the same day; Blur's "Country House" outsold Oasis' "Roll with It" by 58,000 copies during the week.[17] When the band mimed the single on Top of the Pops, Liam pretended to play Noel's guitar and Noel pretended to sing, taking a jibe at the show's lip-syncing format. (What's the Story) Morning Glory? is considered to be a seminal record of the Britpop era and as one of the best albums of the 1990s,[18] and appears in several charts as one of the greatest albums of all time.[19] In 2010, Rolling Stone commented that "the album is a triumph, full of bluster, bravado, and surprising tenderness" and that it "capped a true golden age for Britpop".[20] The magazine ranked the album at No. 378 on its 2012 list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time".[21] The album's enduring popularity within the UK was reflected when it won the BRITs Album of 30 Years at the 2010 BRIT Awards. The award was voted on by the public to decide the greatest Best Album winner in the history of the BRIT Awards.[22] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die

                                Oasis's eagerly anticipated third album, Be Here Now, was released on 21 August 1997 and set a new record as the fastest-selling album in UK Chart history. The album was denounced by Noel in later years,[24] but Liam has defended it.[24] On the first day of release, Be Here Now sold over 424,000 copies and became the fastest-selling album in British chart history; initial reviews were overwhelmingly positive.[25] The band's long-time producer Owen Morris said the recording sessions were marred by arguments and drug abuse, and that the band's only motivations were commercial.[26] As of 2008, the album had sold eight million copies worldwide. It was the best-selling album of 1997 in the UK, with 1.47 million units sold.[27] The album topped the UK Vinyl Albums Chart in 2016, 19 years after its original release.[28] Creation Records shut down in 1999, after which the Gallagher brothers set up their own label, Big Brother Recordings, for all future Oasis releases. Future album and singles were marked with codes starting with "RKID" ("our kid", Northern English slang for a sibling or younger relative). Oasis returned in 2000 with the album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. Founding members Bonehead and Guigsy left during the recording, leaving Liam as the only member remaining from the band's pre-Oasis lineup. The album featured the band's first song written by Liam, "Little James", written for his then-wife Patsy Kensit's son James.[29] This song, along with the album as a whole, received generally mixed reviews.

                                Oasis's next album, Heathen Chemistry, was released in 2002 and featured three more songs written by Liam. One of them was "Songbird", an acoustic ballad about his love for Nicole Appleton, whom he would later marry. The song was the fourth single from the album and reached No. 3 in the UK charts. Later that year, Gallagher broke several teeth and sustained injuries to his face after a fight broke out at a Munich bar. He and Oasis drummer Alan White were arrested but released without charge. Oasis had to pull out of the shows in Munich and Düsseldorf due to Liam's injuries. 2005 saw the release of Oasis's sixth studio album, Don't Believe the Truth, featuring a further three compositions by Liam: "Love Like a Bomb" (co-written with rhythm guitarist Gem Archer), "The Meaning of Soul", and "Guess God Thinks I'm Abel". The album won two Q Awards: a special People's Choice Award and Best Album.[30] Gallagher joined the rest of Oasis to receive the Outstanding Contribution to Music Award at the BRIT Awards in 2007. As the band picked up the award, he commented on stage, "Seeing as we don't get nominated for this shit no more, this'll have to do." Around the same time, it was announced that he was in negotiations with the makers of Channel 4 afternoon quiz Countdown to appear as the weekly celebrity guest in "Dictionary Corner".

                                2008 saw the release of the band's final album Dig Out Your Soul, which featured three Liam-written songs: "I'm Outta Time", "Ain't Got Nothin'", and "Soldier On". Dig Out Your Soul went straight to No. 1 on the UK Album Charts and reached No. 5 in the U.S. 200 Billboard Charts. In the UK, the album sold 90,000 copies on its first day of release, making it the second-fastest selling album of 2008, behind Coldplay's Viva la Vida. It debuted on the UK Albums Chart at No. 1 with first-week sales of 200,866 copies, making it the 51st fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S. with 53,000 copies sold.[32] It is the highest chart position of any Oasis album in the U.S. since Be Here Now, which debuted at No. 2, but fewer total opening week sales than Don't Believe the Truth.[32] It spent over 30 weeks in the French Albums Chart.[33] Many critics lauded Dig Out Your Soul as one of the band's strongest albums, one opined that "it seems Oasis have made something that can happily play alongside Morning Glory".[34] In August 2009, during the tour in support of the album, the band split up due to Noel not being able to work with Liam any more.

                                Gallagher's voice has been compared to a blend of John Lennon and Johnny Rotten. He has stated he has no clear influence other than Lennon and "music" itself, though he has been known to incorporate many different forms such as punk, indie, new wave, and jazz.[120] On his singing, Spin magazine states that he "twists vowels to the stretching point Johnny Rotten-style — 'sun-shee-ine'".[121] On the Definitely Maybe DVD, Gallagher revealed that the reason he sings with his arms behind his back is because it allows him to project more power through his voice. His singing pose also sees him leaning forward, arching his head up towards the mic on the stand.

                                In 2017, Gallagher admitted that had it not been for pop singer Madonna, he would have never entered the music industry. Recalling a childhood anecdote, he said he was "blown away" the first time he heard her song "Like a Virgin".

                                On 7 April 1997, Gallagher married actress Patsy Kensit at Marylebone Town Hall.[133] Two months later, he began an affair with singer Lisa Moorish in Los Angeles, and she gave birth to a daughter named Molly on 26 March 1998. Gallagher did not meet Molly until May 2018,[134] after which he expressed hope that he would have a continued presence in her life.[135] Molly would later change her surname on her social media profiles from "Moorish" to "Moorish-Gallagher".[136] Gallagher and Kensit's son, Lennon Francis Gallagher, was born on 13 September 1999. The couple divorced in 2000. Gallagher's second son, Gene Gallagher, was born to Canadian singer Nicole Appleton on 2 July 2001.[137] After being together for nearly eight years, Gallagher and Appleton married on 14 February 2008, also at Marylebone Town Hall.

                                From 2011 to 2012, Gallagher had an affair with journalist Liza Ghorbani, who gave birth to a daughter named Gemma in January 2013. The affair was publicly revealed five months later, after he had separated from Appleton and started dating his personal assistant Debbie Gwyther, to whom he referred as his "saviour" for helping him return to making music.[139] During this time, he briefly moved to his mother's house in Ireland, and he was divorced from Appleton in April 2014.[140] His relationship with brother Noel further deteriorated following the severe financial pressures resulting from Liam's divorce and family court settlements, and again when Liam's requests for Noel to take part in an Oasis reunion to help him raise funds were ignored.[141] In 2019, he praised all the mothers of his children for raising the children to be "good people".

                                During a holiday on the Amalfi Coast in August 2019, Gallagher proposed to Gwyther.[142] The couple had intended to marry in Italy in the summer of 2020, but Gallagher announced in June 2020 that the wedding had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[143][144] They live in the Highgate area of London.

                                Gallagher endorsed the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election.[145] He has discussed his concerns on climate change, having publicly praised Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg,[146] and voted for the Green Party in the 2019 UK general election.[147] He has called people involved with cancel culture "fucking squares" and elaborated, "Unless they come around to your house and say you're cancelled, you're still going to do your fucking thing. [...] You can still go and do your gig, there are people out there who are going to like what you’ve got to say."[

                                Gallagher is a lifelong supporter of Manchester City FC.[149] In 2019, he revealed that he never learned how to drive or swim.[150] He has cited Quadrophenia, Scarface, Seven and Trainspotting as his favourite films.

                                Gallagher often goes jogging, but revealed in 2019 that he had begun to suffer from arthritis of the hips and that doctors had advised him to jog less.[152][153] He also suffers from psoriasis,[154] which has forced him to sometimes wear protective gloves,[155] as well as Hashimoto's thyroiditis[156] and hay fever.
                                Gallagher fell out of a helicopter following his headline set at the 2021 Isle of Wight Festival, sustaining cuts and bruises to his face.[158] The injuries were severe enough for Gallagher to delay his performance at the 2021 edition of the Belsonic festival to the 2022 edition.

                                During Oasis's American tour in 1994, Liam frequently changed the words of Noel's songs so that they were offensive to both Americans and Noel. In September 1994, Oasis played at Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. The day of the show Oasis had been using methamphetamine that they believed was cocaine. The band made several mistakes and tensions arose on stage between Liam and Noel, eventually leading to Liam hitting Noel in the head with his tambourine. After the show, Noel shortly left the tour and went to San Francisco.

                                During the 1995 recording sessions for (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, the brothers had a fight when Liam invited everyone from a local pub back to the studio while Noel was trying to work, culminating in Noel hitting Liam over the head with a cricket bat. Noel later described this event as "possibly the biggest fight we ever had".

                                In August 1996, after a record-breaking pair of shows at Knebworth, tension mounted between the Gallaghers when Liam backed out of Oasis's MTV Unplugged set minutes before it was due to start. Noel was forced to fill in at the last minute. Liam said that he had been struck down with a "sore throat" and that he does not like performing acoustically, though Noel has claimed he was hungover.[163] Noel was further angered when Liam heckled him from the balcony while the band performed.[164][165] Four days after, Noel was again forced to fill in for Liam on the first show of their American tour, when Liam refused to travel to America with the rest of the band claiming he needed time to buy a house. He was back on stage with Oasis for their next show three days later in Detroit. Tension between Noel and the rest of the band mounted and Noel left the tour, causing several media outlets to question the future of the band.

                                While on tour in Barcelona in May 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a show when drummer Alan White's arm seized up; the band spent the evening drinking instead. During the night Liam made a crude remark about Noel's wife, Meg Mathews (apparently questioning the legitimacy of Noel's baby daughter Anais), leading to a fight.[166] Following this, a press release was put out declaring that Noel had decided to quit overseas touring with Oasis. The rest of the band, with guitarist Matt Deighton replacing Noel, played the remaining dates.[167] Noel eventually returned for the British and Irish legs of the tour; at the first of these shows the brothers shook hands after the song "Acquiesce".

                                In 2009, prior to the group's break, Noel called Liam "rude, arrogant, intimidating, and lazy", describing him as "the angriest man you'll ever meet [...] like a man with a fork in a world of soup".[168] The final straw for the band came at Rock En Seine in Paris, when an altercation between the brothers (subsequently described by Noel as "no physical violence but there was a lot of World Wrestling Federation stuff") prior to their performance resulted in the destruction of Noel's guitar and saw him announce his departure from the group.[169][170] Liam later claimed he "messed the first one up" when questioned about his 2019 MTV Unplugged performance and has since claimed he missed the show because he "accidentally got drunk again".

                                Liam has stated he does not speak much with Noel and that they "don't really have a relationship". During the final tour, the only time that they ever spoke directly was when onstage.[170] Noel would later reveal that while they were in Oasis, the two "never hung out together outside of the band, ever".[171] Since the band's split, the only direct contact they have had with each other has consisted of exchanging text messages at Christmas; Liam also invited Noel to his wedding, which was scheduled to take place in 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic, but does not believe Noel will attend.[172] When speaking to Sky News, Noel denied any invite being received and remarked that as he was not invited to Liam's previous weddings "I'm not going to go to this one, am I?".[173][174] Despite their constant fighting, the Gallaghers showed mutual affection before, during, and after their time in Oasis. Liam often calls Noel the best songwriter in the world, while Noel frequently calls Liam "cooler" than himself and praises Liam's good looks.[175][176] Noel has said that Oasis came down to the relationship between him and Liam.[177] Weeks prior to this, Noel said Liam was "obsessed with him", leading Liam to allege the same thing about Noel.
