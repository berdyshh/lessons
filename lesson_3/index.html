                            Christopher John Cornell (né Boyle; July 20, 1964 – May 18, 2017) was an American singer and musician best known as the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and primary lyricist and songwriter for the rock bands Soundgarden and Audioslave. He also had a solo career and contributed to numerous movie soundtracks. Cornell was also the founder and frontman of Temple of the Dog, a one-off tribute band dedicated to his late friend Andrew Wood.

                            Cornell is considered one of the key figures of the 1990s grunge movement, and is well known for his extensive catalog as a songwriter, his nearly four-octave vocal range,[2] and his powerful vocal belting technique. He released four solo studio albums, Euphoria Morning (1999), Carry On (2007), Scream (2009), and Higher Truth (2015); the live album Songbook (2011); and two compilations, The Roads We Choose (2007) and Chris Cornell (2018), the latter released posthumously. He received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his song "The Keeper", which appeared in the 2011 film Machine Gun Preacher, and co-wrote and performed "You Know My Name", the theme song to the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale. His last solo release before his death was the charity single "The Promise", written for the ending credits for the 2016 film of the same name.

                            Across his entire catalog, Cornell sold 14.8 million albums, 8.8 million digital songs, and 300 million on-demand audio streams in the U.S. alone,[3][4] as well as over 30 million records worldwide.[5][6][7] He was nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, winning three.[8][9] He was voted "Rock's Greatest Singer" by readers of Guitar World,[10] and ranked No. 4 on the list of "Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists" by Hit Parader,[11] No. 9 on the list of "Best Lead Singers of All Time" by Rolling Stone,[12] and No. 12 on MTV's "22 Greatest Voices in Music".[13]

                            Cornell struggled with depression for most of his life. He was found dead in his Detroit hotel room in the early hours of May 18, 2017, after performing at a Soundgarden concert an hour earlier at the Fox Theatre. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.[3]

                            Cornell was born Christopher John Boyle on July 20, 1964,[14][15] in Seattle, Washington, where he was raised. His parents are Edward F. Boyle,[16] a pharmacist of Irish Catholic descent,[17][18] and Karen Boyle (née Cornell),[16][18] an accountant of Jewish background and self-proclaimed psychic.[19][17][20][21] After his parents' divorce when he was a teenager, he and his siblings adopted their mother's maiden name, Cornell, as their surname.[20][14] Cornell was one of six children; he had two older brothers and three younger sisters.[14] He attended Christ the King, a Catholic elementary school,[22] where he performed for the first time in front of a crowd, singing the 1960s anti-war song "One Tin Soldier".

                        <p>
                            He attended Shorewood High School where he later dropped out.[23][24][25] When he was in seventh grade, his mother pulled him and his sister out of Catholic school; Cornell claimed because they were about to be expelled for being too inquisitive.[26] He recalled the episode in a 1994 interview: "With a religion like that, it's not designed for anyone to question. Being young people who have a natural curiosity and half a brain, you're going to start finding inconsistencies, which there are tons of in organized religion. We both sort of made it clear in classroom situations that we didn't get it. 'Explain this to me.' And they couldn't, so we started creating a lot of problems."

                            Cornell took piano and guitar lessons as a child.[31] He once explained that his mother saved his life when she bought him a snare drum, the instrument he adopted in beginning his path to become a rock musician.[20] Before becoming a successful musician, he worked as a busboy,[34] as a dishwasher,[34] as a fish monger at a seafood wholesaler[30] and was a sous-chef at Ray's Boathouse in Seattle.[35]

                            In the early 1980s, Cornell was a member of a cover band called The Shemps, which featured bassist Hiro Yamamoto and performed around Seattle.[36] After Yamamoto left The Shemps, the band recruited guitarist Kim Thayil.[36] Cornell and Yamamoto stayed in contact, and after The Shemps broke up, the pair started jamming together, eventually bringing Thayil in to join them

                            Along with Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden quickly became one of the most successful bands from Seattle's emerging grunge scene in the early 1990s. With Shepherd, the new line-up recorded Badmotorfinger in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and Soundgarden found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene. Badmotorfinger included the singles "Jesus Christ Pose", "Outshined" and "Rusty Cage". The three singles gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations, while the videos for "Outshined" and "Rusty Cage" gained considerable airtime on MTV. The song "Jesus Christ Pose" and its music video was the subject of widespread controversy in 1991, and the video was removed from MTV's playlist. "Rusty Cage" was later covered by Johnny Cash on his 1996 album, Unchained. "Room a Thousand Years Wide" was released (along with the B-side "HIV Baby") as a 7" single through Sub Pop's Single of the Month club a full year before the release of Badmotorfinger, and later re-recorded for the album. Badmotorfinger exposed Soundgarden to its first mainstream success: it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992,[38] and was later ranked number 45 in the October 2006 issue of Guitar World on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time.

                            Around 12:15 a.m. on May 18, 2017,[261] Cornell's bodyguard found him unconscious in the bathroom of his hotel room, 1136, at the MGM Grand in Detroit, Michigan, after performing at a show with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre on May 17.[262] He was lying on the floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth.[263] An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell.[261] Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30 a.m., at the age of 52. The cause of death was officially ruled a suicide by hanging.[261] Police ruled out foul play by reviewing a hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after Cornell's bodyguard left at around 11:35 p.m.

                            On June 2, 2017, the Wayne County Medical Examiner released its autopsy[265] and toxicology report in the death of Cornell.[266] The medical examiner confirmed that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death was ruled as suicide, adding that Cornell's injuries were all "consistent with hanging, partially suspended by the resistance exercise band,"[265] and that "drugs did not contribute" to the cause of death.[265] Only prescription medications in therapeutic doses were found in Cornell's system:[266] the sedative Butalbital (5.4 µg/mL), commonly prescribed for the treatment of headache; four doses (41 ng/mL) of the anti-anxiety medication lorazepam (also known as Ativan); the decongestant pseudoephedrine (170 ng/mL) and its metabolite norpseudoephedrine (10 ng/mL); caffeine (from No-Doz tablets that Cornell had ingested);[266][267] and naloxone (used to reverse opioid overdoses), which was reportedly administered by emergency personnel upon their arrival at the scene.[266][268] No pills were found in Cornell's stomach.[265] Cornell's widow stated that the Ativan was prescribed to him in 2016 as a sleep aid.[269] Photos from Cornell's hotel room[270] showed that his prescription for Ativan was "1 tablet every 12 hours."

                        <p>
                            Cornell's widow contacted insurance lawyer Kirk Pasich within a few minutes after her husband's death.[272] Pasich became the spokesperson for the widow and blamed Ativan for the singer's death, stating that Cornell would not intentionally take his own life.[273][272] Cornell's widow said, "When we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different. When he told me he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him."[273][274] Following the release of the autopsy and toxicology report, Cornell's widow released a statement to the press.

                            Cornell publicly talked about his struggle with depression, isolation, and suicidal thoughts several times throughout his life. This started after Cornell stated he had ingested PCP for the first and only time, causing a "deep scar on his psyche." This changed his life overnight. He said he became an introvert, experienced anxiety and depression, dealing with this period for over two years.[277] Following Cornell's death, his older brother, Peter, started a campaign to raise awareness of depression and suicide prevention.[278] A few days later, Peter revealed that he was being bullied and threatened to change the narrative of his awareness message, stating "this bullying is coming from a place I never could have imagined".[278] In October 2017, Peter reacted to criticism directed at him on social media by his brother's mother-in-law. He talked about the stigma surrounding mental illness and the addiction narrative being spun by his brother's widow and her family to explain Cornell's death, stating, "And there is that word again. Stigma. Somehow it's 'sexy' to be an addict (of which I am also familiar), but let's not talk about mental illness. Stigma. There are those who re-victimize and bully us. Taunt and demand us to re-live and tell the details of our painful upbringing. To what end? It doesn't erase the damage done. It doesn't turn back the hands of time. We are survivors."

                            On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department[280] released the full police report on Cornell's death,[263] along with photographs from Cornell's hotel room[270] and the 911 call from the MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death.[281] The call was made by a hotel employee at 12:56 a.m., reporting "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136."[282] According to the report, Martin Kirsten (Cornell's bodyguard) was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30 p.m. to help him with his computer. It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35 p.m. Alarmed by what she heard, Vicky phoned Kirsten to ask him to check on her husband "because he did not sound like he was OK."[283] According to Vicky, Cornell kept saying, "I am just tired," and hung up the phone.[263] A call from Vicky at 12:15 a.m. prompted Kirsten to go to Cornell's suite to check on him.[263] Unable to enter the room because of the interior latch, Kirsten returned to his room and called hotel security. Security refused to assist.

                            On November 1, 2018, Vicky Cornell and her children filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming that Dr. Robert Koblin "negligently and repeatedly" prescribed "dangerous mind-altering controlled substances to Chris Cornell which impaired Mr. Cornell's cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life."[286] The suit claims Koblin prescribed lorazepam over a period of 20 months without seeing Cornell.[286] In his motion for dismissal, Koblin denied all accusations of negligence and said that Cornell was well aware of the risks inherent to the medication, which he was taking to treat anxiety. Koblin ordered Cornell the first prescription of lorazepam in September 2015. Koblin insisted that he did everything within his power to help Cornell, and that a malpractice law should shield him from being sued.[287] In April 2021, the two parties settled on a confidential agreement.
